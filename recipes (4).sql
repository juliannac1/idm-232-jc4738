When meal prep requires a delicate touch—think eggs over easy or a seared salmon fillet—our culinary team grabs this even- heating, toxin-free pan. The patented ceramic titanium coating stands up to utensils (yes, even metal!), and best of all, itʼs easy to clean.', 'Prepare & roast the squash:\r\nPlace an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Using a sharp, sturdy knife, carefully halve the squash lengthwise; using a spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds. Place in a baking dish, cut side up. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; arrange cut side down. Fill the dish with 1/4 inch of water. Roast 32 to 35 minutes, or until the cut side of the squash is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\r\n \r\n*While the squash roasts, in a small saucepan, combine the rice, lime leaf, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat. Carefully remove and discard the lime leaf. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Cover and set aside in a warm place.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Prepare the remaining ingredients:\r\nWhile the rice cooks, peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Quarter the lime. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; thinly slice crosswise. Pick the mint leaves off the stems; discard the stems.\r\n \r\n\r\n*Cook the aromatics:\r\nWhile the rice continues to cook, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n*To the pan, add the coconut milk (shaking the can just before opening), sugar, and as much of the curry paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n \r\n\r\n*Finish the curry & serve your dish:\r\nWhen cool enough to handle, using a fork, scrape the flesh of the roasted squash into a bowl; separate any clumps. (The result should resemble cooked spaghetti.) Discard the skins. Add the squash and sliced bok choy to the pan of curry. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat. Stir in the juice of 2 lime wedges; season with salt and pepper to taste. Top the cooked rice with the finished curry. Garnish with the mung beans and mint leaves (tearing just before adding). Serve with the remaining lime wedges on the side.
